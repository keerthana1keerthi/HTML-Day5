# Day 5 – HTML Form Practice

# Overview:
This day focused on designing a user input form using HTML5. The form allows the collection of key personal information such as name, email, age, gender, and citizenship status.

# Features:
- Text input fields: First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, Age
- Date input: Date of Birth
- Radio buttons for:
  - Gender (Male, Female, Others)
  - Indian citizenship status
- Submit and Reset buttons

# What I Practiced:
- Using `<form>` and various `<input>` types
- Applying `required` attributes for validation
- Proper label associations with `for` and `id`
- Creating grouped radio buttons using the same `name` attribute

 # Next Steps:
- Add styling with CSS
- Secure form handling with `type="password"` for sensitive fields
- Connect to a backend for actual form submission
